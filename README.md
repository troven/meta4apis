meta4node - executable wireframe server
=======================================

A lightweight server for meta4beta.

meta4beta helps you to quickly build fully working, interactive applications for web and mobile without (much) coding.

The core of meta4beta is a JSON configuration that declares, defines and orchestrates your application models, views and business logic.

It uses a configuration over convention approach, allowing a high level of design-time flexability with a simple JSON-based syntax.

meta4beta is based on Backbone & Marionette, because they provide a minimally opinated framework that is easy to understand, extend and scale.
