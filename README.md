meta4node - executable wireframe server
=======================================

A lightweight server for 'meta4' written in NodeJS and ExpressJS.

What is 'meta4'? It's a front-end framework for building applications using meta-data to define an application rather than code.

We built meta4 to streamline the construction of interactive apps, prototypes & MVPs without (much) coding.

We believe that it provides a high level of design-time flexibility with a sane JSON syntax.

The result is responsive, maintainable application that can be rapidly constructed & deployed.

Meta4's meta-model defines and orchestrates your application models, views, business logic and HTML templates.

meta4beta is based on Backbone & Marionette, because they provide a minimally opinated framework that is easy to understand, extend and scale.
