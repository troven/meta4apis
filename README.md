meta4node - application server
==============================

A lightweight but powerful server for 'meta4' written in NodeJS, ExpressJS & Socket.io.

What is 'meta4'? It's a way to specify applications using meta-data instead of defining an application in code.

It forms the basis for lots of current & future meta4 runtime projects, but it's designed to be useful by itself.

We built meta4 to streamline the construction of interactive apps, prototypes & MVPs without (much) coding.

We believe that it provides a high level of design-time flexibility with a sane JSON syntax.

The result is responsive, maintainable application that can be rapidly constructed & deployed.
